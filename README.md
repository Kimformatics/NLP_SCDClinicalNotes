# NLP_SCDClinicalNotes
Sickle cell disease (SCD), one of the most common inherited disorders, was first described in the early 20th century and identified as a genetic condition in 1949. Despite significant technological advancements in treating other hematologic conditions, individuals living with SCD have yet to fully benefit from these innovations.

During my master’s studies in chemistry at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill under the mentorship of Dr. Leslie Parise’s and following a lab rotation with her group, I was selected a sickle cell research project that became my thesis. The project investigated a protein implicated in vaso-occlusive crises—a severe and painful complication frequently experienced by individuals with SCD.

In a recent effort to brush up on my electronic health records (EHR) “chops”, I created a synthetic dataset of clinical notes resembling those typically found in the medical charts of SCD patients. As clinical notes data is often unstructured, it requires advanced analytics to extract meaningful insights.

Using this synthetic dataset, I conducted an analysis in R and Python, leveraging natural language processing (NLP) to generate a word cloud. This exercise not only allowed me to explore potential differences in outcomes between the two tools but also provided a valuable opportunity to refamiliarize myself with EHR-style data while addressing a critical health issue that impacts B lack and minority communities.
